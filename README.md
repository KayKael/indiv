# Finance Management System with AI Integration (INDIV)

## Overview

The **Finance Management System** is a web application designed to help users manage their personal finances effectively. It utilizes advanced artificial intelligence techniques to provide users with insights, budgeting assistance, and personalized financial recommendations. The system aims to empower users by providing them with tools to track their spending, set financial goals, and receive guidance tailored to their financial behavior.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login functionality, allowing users to manage their accounts safely.
- **Transaction Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete financial transactions, categorizing them for better organization and tracking.
- **Budget Management**: Create and manage budgets based on user-defined financial goals. The system provides visualizations to help users track their progress.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Leverages AI to analyze user data and generate personalized insights and suggestions for savings and budgeting improvements.
- **Dashboard**: An interactive user interface that displays an overview of the user's financial health, including income, expenses, and budget status.
- **Notifications**: Users receive alerts and reminders about upcoming bills, budget limits, and financial milestones.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask or Django for server-side logic, RESTful APIs, and database management.
- **Frontend**: JavaScript with frameworks like React or Vue.js for a responsive and interactive user experience.
- **Database**: Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) to store user data, transactions, budgets, and insights.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning models that generate insights and recommendations.

## Design and Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns. The backend handles business logic and data management, while the frontend manages user interactions. The AI component integrates seamlessly with both to enhance user experience.

- **Class Diagram**: The system is designed with a set of well-defined classes representing the main entities, including User, Transaction, BudgetManager, Dashboard, Insight, and Notification. Each class has attributes and methods relevant to its role in the system.
- **Relationship Types**: The relationships between classes are established using various UML relationship types, ensuring clarity in the systemâ€™s structure.
